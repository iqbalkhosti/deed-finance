# deed-leisure

Deed-leisure is a finance based project that will help people use the credit card points more efficiently and easily. It will use a mix of financial algorithms, LLMS and RPA. This is is aimed to be free of charge and used for personal portfolio and experience. I will not open-source the project as it is has financial application. As soon as I have the confidence and means to support it's open-source nature, I would do it.
